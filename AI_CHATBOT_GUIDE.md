- Specific improvement recommendations
- Industry context and benchmarking
- Implementation strategies

## Sample Questions

### Energy Optimization
- "How can I reduce energy consumption in my highest-impact stage?"
- "What renewable energy options would work best for my project?"
- "What's the potential energy savings from circular practices?"

### Water Management
- "Where can I implement water recycling systems?"
- "What's my water footprint compared to industry standards?"
- "How can I reduce water usage in production stages?"

### Waste Reduction
- "What circular design principles should I implement?"
- "How can I increase my recycling percentage?"
- "What's the waste reduction potential of my project?"

### Carbon Footprint
- "What are my main sources of CO2 emissions?"
- "How can I achieve carbon neutrality?"
- "What transport optimizations would reduce my carbon footprint?"

### Sustainability Scoring
- "Why is my sustainability score X%?"
- "What specific actions will improve my score most?"
- "How do I compare to industry benchmarks?"

## Configuration

### OpenAI Integration (Optional)
The chatbot works in two modes:

1. **Demo Mode** (Default): Provides intelligent responses using pattern matching and your project data
2. **AI-Powered Mode**: Uses OpenAI's GPT models for advanced natural language understanding

To enable AI-Powered mode:

1. Get an OpenAI API key from [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env`
3. Add your API key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here`
4. Restart the server

### Environment Variables
```env
# Required
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/lca_database
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret

# Optional - for enhanced AI responses
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React component with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Express.js API endpoints
- **AI Service**: OpenAI GPT-4 integration with fallback responses
- **Context**: Full report data provided to AI for accurate responses

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/chatbot/chat/:projectId` - Send message and get AI response
- `GET /api/chatbot/insights/:projectId` - Get AI-generated summary insights
- `GET /api/chatbot/suggestions/:projectId` - Get contextual question suggestions

### Security
- JWT token authentication required
- User can only access their own project data
- API rate limiting implemented
- No sensitive data stored in chat logs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Chatbot not responding:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the backend server is running
- Ensure you have a valid authentication token

**"Demo mode" responses:**
- This means OpenAI API key is not configured
- Demo mode still provides intelligent insights based on your data
- To enable full AI features, add your OpenAI API key to the environment

**Error messages:**
- Check the browser console for detailed error information
- Verify your project has generated report data
- Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible

### Getting Help
1. Check the browser developer console for error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
3. Ensure environment variables are configured properly
4. Check server logs for backend issues
